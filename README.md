# SW Club Chatbot
I worked on a chatbot project aimed at improving the club's website at the Software Entrepreneurship Club. After studying software fundamentals and acquiring basic backend knowledge, I began the project. Although it was my first time using HTML and web server tools, I approached the project with great interest.

The main goal of the project was to add a chatbot function to the website, allowing users to address any questions they had about the club. While the implementation and integration of the chatbot were successfully completed, I wasn't able to develop the functionality for the model to learn and respond based on the website's content. This aspect was left as a future development task.

Through this project, I was able to acquire important skills in web development and chatbot integration, and it remains a project with significant potential for further development.
